**vr2xr Neo is an Android VR SBS video player for XREAL One and XREAL One Pro glasses.** It supports local files, HTTP(S) URLs, Android share intents, and SMB2/SMB3 network shares, with phone controls and IMU head tracking.

This repository is a maintained fork of [Skarian/vr2xr](https://github.com/skarian/vr2xr). The original project and author are credited below; the fork-specific improvements are highlighted in [What this fork adds](#what-this-fork-adds).

## What this fork adds

> **This fork goes well beyond maintenance:** it adds high-performance network playback, two new VR180 projection models, faster FOV controls, and a more streamlined tracking workflow while preserving the original vr2xr playback experience.

- **Native SMB2/SMB3 playback** — Browse network shares with thumbnails and sorting, then stream and seek through large videos using native `libsmb2`, with `jcifs-ng` as a compatibility fallback.
- **Broader VR180 format support** — Play half-equirectangular, equidistant-fisheye, and equisolid-fisheye content, with independent view and lens FOV tuning.
- **Faster view control** — Drag directly to adjust the view, pinch with two fingers to change FOV, use dedicated 5° FOV buttons, and double-tap to recenter.
- **Smoother setup flow** — Enter calibration only when tracking requires it, launch calibration automatically after connection, and optionally hide the recurring Full SBS reminder.
- **Security and maintainability** — Encrypt saved SMB passwords with Android Keystore, document bundled dependencies and privacy behavior, and cover the new policies with unit tests.

### Detailed changes from the original project

The comparison baseline is the upstream `main` branch at [`52673c5`](https://github.com/skarian/vr2xr/commit/52673c58b376c96a19426bf2a1cff24bd0484685).

| Area | Changes in this fork |
| --- | --- |
| Video sources | Added an in-app SMB2/SMB3 entry point and network-share browser. Local files continue to use Android's system document picker. |
| SMB browsing | Added server/share/domain/account login, folder navigation, supported-video filtering, thumbnails, newest/oldest sorting, saved profiles, and profile removal. |
| SMB playback | Added a Media3 SMB data source with buffered random access for playback and seeking. Native `libsmb2` is preferred for throughput; `jcifs-ng` is retained as a fallback. |
| Credential privacy | Saved SMB passwords are encrypted with AES-GCM using a non-exportable Android Keystore key. Server metadata stays in the app's private storage. |
| Projection modes | Added VR180 fisheye equidistant and fisheye equisolid rendering in addition to the original half-equirectangular mode. |
| Projection controls | Added a fisheye lens-FOV control (`160°–220°`), expanded view-FOV control (`25°–175°`), fixed slider stepping, and persisted projection settings. |
| Touchpad controls | Replaced continuous edge auto-drag with direct drag plus two-finger pinch-to-change-FOV. Added `FOV -` / `FOV +` buttons with 5° steps; double-tap recenters the view. |
| Tracking flow | Calibration is opened automatically after glasses connect when no tracking stream exists. A selected video proceeds through calibration only when required, then to the Full SBS reminder. |
| SBS reminder | Added a **Do not show this again** option for the Full SBS readiness screen. |
| Launcher and player UI | Added the SMB action, changed requirements help to a labeled button, reorganized player controls, and updated project attribution in the app. |
| Maintenance | Added unit coverage for tracking launch policy, SMB browsing/playback policy, and projection configuration; documented bundled third-party SMB components and privacy behavior. |

## Features

- **XREAL One support**: Live head tracking, connection status, factory bias correction, recalibration, adjustable IMU sensitivity, and an IMU tracking toggle
- **Multiple video sources**: Local files, `http(s)` URLs, Android share intents, and built-in SMB2/SMB3 network shares
- **SMB media browser**: Browse folders, show video thumbnails, sort by modification date, and remember multiple server profiles
- **High-throughput SMB playback**: Native `libsmb2` random-access reading and seeking, with a `jcifs-ng` compatibility fallback
- **Multiple VR180 projections**: Half equirectangular, fisheye equidistant, and fisheye equisolid projection
- **Live projection tuning**: Change view FOV and fisheye lens FOV while playing; settings are saved locally
- **Phone playback controls**: Play/pause, 15-second seek, timeline scrubbing, projection controls, and a touchpad for view adjustment
- **Guided tracking setup**: Automatic calibration entry when needed, followed by an optional Full SBS reminder
- **Durable playback sessions**: Playback pauses when glasses output disappears and can resume after the output returns

## Requirements

- XREAL One or XREAL One Pro glasses
- Android 13 or newer (`minSdk = 33`)
- Samsung DeX desktop mode is not supported; use screen mirroring instead

Phone-only playback is intentionally unsupported. The app does not switch the glasses into SBS mode; that setting remains under user/device control.

## App guide

1. Connect the XREAL One or XREAL One Pro glasses.
2. Select a source:
   - tap **Open file** for Android's system file picker;
   - enter an `http(s)` URL and tap **Open URL**;
   - tap **Open SMB share** for a network share; or
   - share a video link/file to vr2xr from another Android app.
3. If calibration is required, place the glasses on a flat surface and tap **Run Calibration**.
4. Put the glasses back on and set `Display > 3D Mode` to `Full SBS`. The reminder can be hidden for future launches.
5. Tap **Continue to VR Player**. The app applies Zero View automatically.
6. Use the phone controls to play, pause, seek, adjust projection, and change the view.

If the glasses are disconnected during playback, the video pauses and waits for the glasses output to return.

## Player controls

- **Single-finger drag**: Adjust yaw and pitch
- **Two-finger pinch**: Change the view FOV continuously
- **Double-tap**: Recenter the view
- **FOV - / FOV +**: Change view FOV in 5° steps
- **Glasses settings**: Recalibrate, change IMU sensitivity, or disable/enable IMU tracking
- **Projection settings**: Select the projection model and tune view/lens FOV
- **Playback row**: Seek backward/forward 15 seconds, play/pause, or scrub the timeline

## SMB shares

Enter the server host/IP address and share name. Domain, username, and password are available for authenticated shares. Enable **Remember this account securely** to save the profile on the device; long-press a saved profile to remove it.

The browser shows folders and supported videos, generates thumbnails when possible, and can sort entries newest-first or oldest-first. Video data is read directly from the SMB server and is not copied to the developer or an intermediary service.

## Build and test

Clone with submodules, or initialize them after cloning:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Use JDK 17 plus the Android SDK/NDK configured by the project, then run:

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The debug APK is generated under `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`. More development details are in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Privacy and third-party components

- See [`PRIVACY_POLICY.md`](PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for local data and SMB credential handling.
- See [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for the bundled `libsmb2` source and the `jcifs-ng` dependency.
